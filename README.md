================

This contains the R code for our paper.

    Wicher Bergsma, Haziq Jamil (2022). *Additive interaction modelling using I-priors*.

The key documents are

1.  `01-cow.R` contains the code for the functional response model in
    Section 6.
2.  `02-sims.R` contains the code for the simulations in Section 5.

In this README, the main summary of findings are presented.
