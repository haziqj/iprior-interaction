The key documents are

1.  `01-cow.R` contains the code for the functional response model in Section 6.
2.  `02-sims.R` contains the code for the simulations in Section 5.

In this README, the main summary of findings are presented.

## Simulations

Data pairs \$(y_i,x_i)\$, where $x_i\in\mathbb R^3$, were simulated according to the following model

$$
y_i = \beta_1 x_{i1} 
$$

The coefficients for the simulations were as follows.

```{r read_model_code}
```

```{r}
kbl(beta_vals, format = "pipe")
```
